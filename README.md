# Advent of Code 2017

My solutions to the puzzles of Advent of Code 2017.

Please note that these should by no means be seen as _good_ solutions. I just
like to keep them stored on GitHub, and there is no need to make them private.

However, I use these puzzles as a means of improving my Python 'skills'. Since
I find one of the goals of the puzzles to be to solve them as fast as possible,
you might see some terrifying code.
